        The Black Knight Performance Parts’ Muscle Car Parts Superstore is
        committed to bringing our Clients the very best in parts for their
        muscle care at the lowest possible price. With this goal in mind, the
        BKPP low price guarantee was created so our Clients have the assurance
        that they have built the muscle car of their dreams as inexpensively as
        possible. Therefore, we guarantee that we offer to them the lowest price
        on each of the products that we sell. Should any Client find a lower
        price on any product, let us know and we will match it.
      </p>

        If a Client believes that they have found a price on the same product
        that is lower than offered in the BKPP Muscle Car Parts Superstore
        on-line catalog, simply contact us with the source of the lower price
        (usually a web-address), that source’s part number and that source’s
        price. We will then contact that source to confirm that the price is the
        current price and, in fact, lower than offered by BKPP. No matter the
        outcome of our investigation, we will contact you by e- mail to let you
        know of our findings, and, if we find in your favor, give you
        instructions on how to order the product at the matched price.

        This guarantee only applies to the exact same product and does not apply
        to products already purchased or deemed by us to be a loss-leader or
        have a sale, close-out, non-current price or a special offer price.
        Likewise, we will not match pricing on a product on which the
        manufacturer has an MAP or MAP-like pricing policy when that advertised
        price is less than the MAP price. BKPP reserves the right to alter or
        cancel this offer at any time without advanced notice. Finally, as we
        sell the same part by different manufacturers, we will not be able to
        match the price if we are unable to tell who makes the product to which
        we are comparing ours.
