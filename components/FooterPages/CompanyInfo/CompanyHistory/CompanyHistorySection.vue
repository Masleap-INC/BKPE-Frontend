                What is your life dream? What is a life dream? It is the vision that has consumed you since your youth. It is the aspiration that stirs your soul, inspires your greatest passions, motivates your best efforts and to which you subordinate all other endeavors.

                For BKPE founder, Tim Barrett, this dream was born in 1986 when, at the age of 17, he got an awe-inspiring ride in a highly-modified 1969 SS/RS454 Camaro. All true gearheads understand the sensations -- the roar of thumping horsepower, the smell of melting rubber, and the palpitation-inducing acceleration -- and how they become an intoxicating siren. “The goal of BKPE is to retro-engineer 21st century performance into the 21st century into the greatest muscle cars of yesteryear.”.

                In 2005, Tim Barrett and his wife, Kathy Barrett, founded BKPE to fulfill Tim’s life dream: to design, engineer and build the world’s most extreme performance muscle cars. Choosing from the greatest of the muscle cars of yesteryear built by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, the goal of BKPE is to retro-engineer their performance into the 21st century. From this was born the D.I.Y. Muscle Car Kit. Simply pick and then design the muscle car of your wildest imagination at <a href="www.DIYMCK.com" class="underline">www.DIYMCK.com</a>.

                As BKPE began to design its line of the world’s greatest production vehicles, it became apparent that many muscle car aficionados want to build their own vehicles without having to go to the expense of destroying and then restoring a factory-built car. These folks would need a complete kit of all necessary parts for a basic kit and then dozens of options to equip their kits as they desire. From this was born the D.I.Y. Muscle Car Kit. Simply pick and then design a the muscle car of your wildest imagination at <a href="www.DIYMUSCLECARS.com" class="underline">www.DIYMUSCLECARS.com</a>  and in due course, a tractor-trailer will arrive at your facility with everything you need to build it. Nothing could be simpler.

                As BKPE began to build its supply chain for the muscle cars its builds and its D.I.Y. Muscle Car kits, it became obvious that the muscle car community needed a new kind of parts store. This new kind of parts store would carry more than restoration parts, it would carry the most comprehensive line of pro-touring and resto-mod parts available on the market. Indeed, to make it even more comprehensive, we designed our store to incorporate the creativity of the tuner world and the craftsmanship of the hot rod world. From our store our customers could make their wildest vision for the baddest muscle car of their choosing a reality. And they could do this all at the guaranteed lowest price. From this unmet need came the Black Knight Performance Parts Superstore. Designed for the do-it-yourselfer who knows exactly what he wants to build or wants to browse our huge selection for new ideas among the state-of-the-art in muscle car parts, <a href="www.BKSUPERSTORE.com" class="underline">www.BKSUPERSTORE.com</a> is your one-stop shop for all your muscle car desires.

                Because our heart will always be with the muscle car, our researching, designing and building these amazing cars has allowed us to amass a large volume of knowledge and wisdom, information BKPE desires to share with the muscle car community. At <a href="www.MUSCLECARMATRIX.com" class="underline">www.MUSCLECARMATRIX.com</a> you can find the standard de-coding and options information found on other sites, but you will also get restoration and technical information, the latest muscle car news, restoration and modification how-tos, a muscle car yellowpages, and much, much more. If it concerns the muscle car, you will find it in the Muscle Car Matrix. Stay tuned as this exciting project develops.

                But muscle cars need to be talked about to be fully enjoyed, for the muscle car experience is not just sensory, but it is cerebral. Thus, BKPE created a place where muscle car enthusiasts can talk about their rides and ask questions only other gear heads would appreciate and be able to answer, the Muscle Car Conduit. Got something to say to or ask of your fellow gearheads, <a href="www.MUSCLECARCONDUIT.com" class="underline">www.MUSCLECARCONDUIT.com</a> is the place to be. Stay tuned as this exciting project develops.

                With a strength in the millions of people, muscle car enthusiasts have a level of expertise that is unrivaled in any other hobby. To make a place where this expertise can be shared and disseminated, BKPE created the Muscle Car Matrix (<a href="www.CAMAROMATRIX.com" class="underline">www.CAMAROMATRIX.com</a>). As the premier forum on the internet, our clients can share their vehicles, their stories and their knowledge or ask their questions. Of course, there already a is vast amount of information available about the Camaro that has been compiled and made easy to find in the Camaropedia (www.CAMAROPEDIA.com). But sometimes, Camaro enthusiasts just needs a place to relax and interact with each other in mutually supportive and encouraging ways. For that, BKPE offers Camaro Nation (<a href="www.CAMARONATION.com" class="underline">www.CAMARONATION.com</a>), a social media platform for the exchange of ideas.

                In interacting with the muscle car community, it did not take long to realize that there is still a great need for our fellow-gearheads, each of whom have their own cars and their own visions for how they want their cars to look and perform, to have access to master designers and craftsmen to build their cars. To fill this need we started Black Knight Customs, Inc. Literally, a one-stop shop for any restoration, customization or modernization project. Black Knight Customs, Inc., can meet any need within the community to improve any aspect of any car. If you can dream it, we can design and build it. The first step for the fulfillment of that dream starts at <a href="www.BKCUSTOMCARS.com" class="underline">www.BKCUSTOMCARS.com</a>.
