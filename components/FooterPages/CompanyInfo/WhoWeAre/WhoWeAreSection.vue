                    The BKPP Camaro Parts Guru was born out of our program of designing, building and selling the world’s finest custom muscle cars though our sister company, Black Knight Performance Engineering, Inc. We know these products inside and out because we build our vehicles with them. This gives us a unique perspective on the utility and value of the parts that we sell and motivates us to continually look for the latest new product releases so that we can install them on our vehicles and sell them to our Clients to install their vehicles. A product must meet our high demands before we will consider selling it to our Clients.

We will then move onto C1 and C2 Corvettes. After that, we will consider the Mustang, GM A-Bodies and, of course, Mopars. Stay tuned. And if you want to help us move forward faster, let us know.
