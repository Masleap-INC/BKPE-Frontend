Finally, our customers establish a unique user name and password to identify them and provide them full access of our products and services. We use this information to communicate with you and to process your order.

                    While we do collect our customer’s payment information for the purpose of processing their payments for their orders, this information is not stored on our serves and is deleted as soon as the payment has been processed, unless you give us permission to store that information for future purchases.
